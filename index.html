					<h2>Boston, MA</h2>
					<p>My first trip to the United States was to Boston, MA. I was originally born and raised in Sevilla, Spain; so this was my first overseas adventure away from my family. At the time, I was 17 years young with a lot of energy and curiosity about this city. Here I spent 4 months visiting the tourist areas, studying at Harvard facilities, and playing different golf courses as college tryouts, so eventually, a golf coach offered me a scholarship.</p>

					<h2>Hannibal, MO</h2>
					<p>After spending time in the North East side of the United States I got offered several golf scholarships around the country. Some were better than others, and one of the coaches went all-in with me and offered me a full-ride scholarship to be part of his team; and so I did. I came from the other side of the world and landed in a small town in Mid-West America, Hannibal, MO.</p>

					<h2>Phoenix, AZ</h2>
					<p>In my first year of college, our Conference held one of the most important tournaments of the season in Phoenix, AZ. We got to experience the climate, nature and culture while playing our favorite sport. Recreationally, we played in one of the most iconic golf courses in America, TPC Scottsdale, with the well-known 16th Hole, known as The Stadium Hole. The entire team had the time of their lives during Spring Break, and after all the practicing we played the Conference Tournament at the Conquistador Golf Course, where we placed 2nd, 3 shots shy from 1st place.</p>

					<h2>Sandia Park, NM</h2>
					<p>On the way back, we played several golf courses, but one of them made me look at golf in a different perspective due to its difficulty and challenging layouts of the holes and pin positions. Its breathtaking views and nature's beauty made it hard to focus on the gameplan and as if it were in the course designer's mind when it was built.</p>

					<h2>Myrtle Beach, SC</h2>
					<p>The following year the team decided to take a trip to the opposite side of the country. The Carolinas was a must in my bucket list when I came to the United States, not only because of the 100 quality golf courses, but the sparkling waters, white sands, endless possibilities. Myrtle Beach is never short of fun, the people are interesting who are bursting with Southern charm and hospitality. The city has an eclectic community that thrives on personality and class.</p>

					<h2>Orlando, FL</h2>
					<p>The next trip was to the South East side of the country. Florida reminded me of my home country in many ways other than the weather. The golf courses were in fabolous shape and the people genuinely enjoyed being envolved with people. Orlando is more than just theme parks. It also offers ample shopping opportunities, restaurants and nightlife. If you're are a culture vulture, Orlando is also inundated with art galleries, gardens and a thriving art scenes.</p>

					<h2>Saint Louis, MO</h2>
					<p>In winter of 2014, I graduated from college. The closest big city was Saint Louis, and that's where I went. Here I found my only true-love, who I most admire and inspires me every day and now I call my wife. I developed myself and my professional career, and continue to find my true character by playing golf as much as I can.</p>
					<p>If you want to check out some of my wife's work visit her blog: <a href="https://www.orbitingwildflower.com/">The Orbiting Wildflower</a> and you'll know what I'm talking about.</p>
